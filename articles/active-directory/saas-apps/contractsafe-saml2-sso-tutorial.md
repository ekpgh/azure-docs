# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory single sign-on (SSO) integration with ContractSafe Saml2 SSO

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ContractSafe Saml2 SSO with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate ContractSafe Saml2 SSO with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to ContractSafe Saml2 SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ContractSafe Saml2 SSO with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

To learn more about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [What is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-appssoaccess-whatis).

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ContractSafe Saml2 SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* ContractSafe Saml2 SSO supports **IDP** initiated SSO

## Adding ContractSafe Saml2 SSO from the gallery

To configure the integration of ContractSafe Saml2 SSO into Azure AD, you need to add ContractSafe Saml2 SSO from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ContractSafe Saml2 SSO** in the search box.
1. Select **ContractSafe Saml2 SSO** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for ContractSafe Saml2 SSO

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with ContractSafe Saml2 SSO using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in ContractSafe Saml2 SSO.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with ContractSafe Saml2 SSO, complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    * **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    * **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure ContractSafe Saml2 SSO](#configure-contractsafe-saml2-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    * **[Create ContractSafe Saml2 SSO test user](#create-contractsafe-saml2-sso-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ContractSafe Saml2 SSO that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), on the **ContractSafe Saml2 SSO** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the edit/pen icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, enter the values for the following fields:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://app.contractsafe.com/saml2_auth/<UNIQUEID>/acs/`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://app.contractsafe.com/saml2_auth/<UNIQUEID>/acs/`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [ContractSafe Saml2 SSO Client support team](mailto:donne@contractsafe.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. ContractSafe Saml2 SSO application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, ContractSafe Saml2 SSO application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name | Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| --------------- |
	| emailname | user.userprincipalname |
	| email | user.onpremisesuserprincipalname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up ContractSafe Saml2 SSO** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Copy configuration URLs](common/copy-configuration-urls.png)

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to ContractSafe Saml2 SSO.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **ContractSafe Saml2 SSO**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.

   ![The "Users and groups" link](common/users-groups-blade.png)

1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.

	![The Add User link](common/add-assign-user.png)

1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure ContractSafe Saml2 SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ContractSafe Saml2 SSO** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [ContractSafe Saml2 SSO support team](mailto:donne@contractsafe.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ContractSafe Saml2 SSO test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in ContractSafe Saml2 SSO. Work withÂ [ContractSafe Saml2 SSO support team](mailto:donne@contractsafe.com) to add the users in the ContractSafe Saml2 SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using the Access Panel.

When you click the ContractSafe Saml2 SSO tile in the Access Panel, you should be automatically signed in to the ContractSafe Saml2 SSO for which you set up SSO. For more information about the Access Panel, see [Introduction to the Access Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-saas-access-panel-introduction).
